description: How to install the opencode-await plugin
---

## Installation

Add `opencode-await` to your project's `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-await"]
}
```

That's it! OpenCode will automatically install the plugin on next startup.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to manage the plugin manually, you can symlink it to your local plugin directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/plugin
ln -s /path/to/opencode-await .opencode/plugin/opencode-await
```

## Requirements

- OpenCode v1.0.0 or later
- Bun runtime (for plugin execution)
